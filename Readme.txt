Features:

 • Timing: As you perform the exercise you will hear and see cues that help you time each repetition (rep). Cues such as Prepare, Start, Release, Rest. Timing parameters can be fine-tuned down to the finest detail in order to match your pace exactly.
 • Counting: You specify the number of reps and sets, and My-PT keeps track while you just follow the cues.
 • Scheduling: Assign a schedule to each exercise and My-PT will remind you when it is due. 
 • Instructions: You can enter instructions for each of your exercises, by typing them into the exercise, and / or by adding photos to the exercise. You can choose to automatically show or speak the instructions as you start the exercise. You can also record audio of your own instructions, if you prefer that. Thus, My-PT also serves as a convenient place to keep all your exercise instructions.
 • Feedback to your physical therapist: When you finish an exercise you can mark the difficulty and make notes with questions or feedback to your therapist. You can generate a report that shows this information (PDF format) and email it to your therapist.
 • Workouts: You can string multiple exercises together into workouts, which can play through your entire regimen automatically.
 
 That’s it. What My-PT does not do for you is to provide any pre-defined exercises (other than a couple of examples). You enter each exercise according to your own needs or directions from a physiotherapist
