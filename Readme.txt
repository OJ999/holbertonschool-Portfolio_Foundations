3. Technologies
 In a section named “Technologies”:
-List the libraries, languages, platforms, frameworks, hardware, books, resources that will be necessary to complete your
 project.
-For 2 of these technology choices, describe another option and what were the trade-offs between the chosen technology and
 the alternate. Explain what led to the final decision to use a particular technology.
Answer:

• Technologies

-Languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
-Frameworks: React for frontend development, Node.js for backend development
-Libraries: Redux for state management, Express.js for server-side routing
-Database: MongoDB for storing exercise data and user information
-Tools: Git for version control, VSCode as the integrated development environment (IDE)
-Platform: Web application deployed on AWS (Amazon Web Services)
 
• Trade-offs and Decisions:

-Frontend Framework: React vs AngularReact was chosen for its simplicity, virtual DOM, and strong community support. It
allows for faster rendering of UI components and is more flexible in terms of integration with other libraries and frameworks.
Angular, on the other hand, is a more opinionated framework with a steeper learning curve. While it provides more built-in
features out of the box, it can be more cumbersome for smaller projects and may introduce unnecessary complexity. The decision
to use React was made based on the team's familiarity with it and its suitability for the project's scale and requirements.
-Database: MongoDB vs PostgreSQLMongoDB was selected for its flexibility and scalability, especially for handling unstructured
data such as exercise information. It offers a JSON-like document model, which aligns well with the data structure of many
fitness-related applications. PostgreSQL, on the other hand, is a relational database management system known for its ACID
compliance and strong consistency. It is well-suited for applications with complex relationships between data entities.
However, for My-PT, the non-relational nature of MongoDB better accommodates the dynamic and evolving nature of exercise data.
Additionally, MongoDB's scalability makes it a more suitable choice for potential future expansion of the application.

4. Challenge statement
 In a section named “Challenge”:
-Describe the problem the Portfolio Project is intended to solve.
-Explain what the Portfolio Project will not solve

-Is this project relevant or dependent on a specific locale?
Answer:

<----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

5. Risks
 In a section named “Risks”:
-Describe the technical risks, the potential impact, and what safeguards or alternatives you have in mind
-Describe non-technical risks, the potential impact, and what strategies are in place to prevent these negative outcomes
Answer:

<----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

6. Infrastructure
 In a section called “Infrastructure”:
-Describe your process for branching and merging in your team’s repository (e.g. GitHub flow, Picking the right branch-merge
 strategy)
-Describe your strategy for deployment
-Describe how you will populate your app with data
-Describe what tools, automation or process you will use for testing
Answer:

<----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

7. Existing Solutions
 In a section called “Existing Solutions”:
-List any similar products or solutions that currently exist.
-For each item in the list, explain similarities and differences
-If you intend to reimplement a proven solution, then describe the various proven solutions and why you chose to reimplement
 based on a particular specification.
 As an example, lets say you will develop an image compression algorithm, and decide to go with Transform coding. Utilize this
 section to describe the different classes of image compression, and the various types of compression algorithms and the unique
 aspects of Transform coding.

Part2
1. Rename the document
 Rename the document to be the Project’s name and append “ MVP specification”
Answer:

<----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

2. Architecture
 In a section named “Architecture”:
-Include an illustration or diagram of the Portfolio Project’s MVP. This should include an end-to-end map for the data
 flowing through your system. Each part of the diagram should be clearly labeled.
 Here are some resources to learn more:
-Web Architecture 101
-List of tools to create architecture diagrams
-Web Application Architecture
Answer:

<----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

3. APIs
 In a section called “APIs and Methods”:
-List and describe the API routes that you will be creating for your web client to communicate with your web server
-List and describe any API endpoints or function/methods that you will be creating to allow any other clients to use
-List and describe any 3rd party APIs that you will be using
Answer:

<----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

4. Data Modelling
 In a section named “Data Model”:
-Create a data model diagram to clarify how data will be stored
Answer:

<----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

5. User Stories
 First, research what user stories are, and how to write them. Also note some pitfalls of creating user stories that are too
 general.
 In the “User Stories” section:
-Define 3-5 detailed user stories that will be satisfied when your MVP is complete.
Answer:

<----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

6. Mockups
 If there is any visual interface to your Portfolio Project, this section is required. If your project lives on the commandline,
 or in script, then do not include this section. Use a prototyping tool, like Balsamiq, to draft your user-facing visual
 interfaces.
 In a section called “Mockups”:
-Include a mockup of each view that will need to be created for your MVP
Answer:

<----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<!-- Features -->

 • Timing: As you perform the exercise you will hear and see cues that help you time each repetition (rep). Cues such as
 Prepare, Start, Release, Rest. Timing parameters can be fine-tuned down to the finest detail in order to match your pace
 exactly.
 • Counting: You specify the number of reps and sets, and My-PT keeps track while you just follow the cues.
 • Scheduling: Assign a schedule to each exercise and My-PT will remind you when it is due. 
 • Instructions: You can enter instructions for each of your exercises, by typing them into the exercise, and / or by adding
 photos to the exercise. You can choose to automatically show or speak the instructions as you start the exercise. You can also
 record audio of your own instructions, if you prefer that. Thus, My-PT also serves as a convenient place to keep all your
 exercise instructions.
 • Feedback to your physical therapist: When you finish an exercise you can mark the difficulty and make notes with questions
 or feedback to your therapist. You can generate a report that shows this information (PDF format) and email it to your
 therapist.
 • Workouts: You can string multiple exercises together into workouts, which can play through your entire regimen automatically.
 
 That’s it. What My-PT does not do for you is to provide any pre-defined exercises (other than a couple of examples). You
 enter each exercise according to your own needs or directions from a physiotherapist
